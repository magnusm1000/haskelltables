The exercises fit the contents of the course ""Programmierung und Modellierung""","The exercises are factually correct.
","The exercise instructions are understandable and clearly formulated.
",The exercises promote my understanding of functional programming.,The exercises are varied and creatively designed.,  The difficulty of the exercises is appropriate.  ,The exercises that I worked on were too difficult,The exercises I worked on were not challenging.,"The exercises repeat too much in terms of content.
",The AI-generated feedback is helpful for my learning.,The presented tests and the generated feedback are easy to follow.  ,"The app could partly replace human feedback (e.g., from tutorials).
","The app motivates me to work on the exercises.

For example the Call-by-Need etc. Only say that it’s wrong without any additional information. It would be great to know there if there maybe was some explanation for what is wrong then. I love the idea of an app like that, since the exercises alone can be a little confusing, especially if not provided with solution. I think a great addition to the app would be if there was a section that maybe also provides additional information on the topic that explains for example what Call-by-Value actually it. What I really liked is that the test results were provided, so that finding a correct solution is easier. However one thing that might be a great addition is to add syntax highlighting."

Super arbeit! So ein System wäre sehr hilfreich, wenn es in die Vrolesung integriert werden würde! 

Zu dem System selbst: Bei ein zwei Aufgaben habe ich immer eine Fehlermeldung bekommen, obwohl diese Aufgaben eigentlich korrekt sein sollten. Weder ich noch ChatGPT konnten ein fehler entdecken. Bei den Auswertungsreihenfolgen wäre eine möglichkeit für eine Musterlösung super oder ein Feedback. Ich finde meinen Fehler manchmal einfach nicht und es gibt keine Möglichkeit herauszufinden was das Problem ist.

Bei der Aufgabe minValueTree bekomme ich eine Fehlermeldung für einen falschen Test
""Dein Code für minValueTree ist grundsätzlich korrekt, aber der Compiler weiß beim Test ""minValueTree Empty == Nothing"" nicht, welchen konkreten Typ er für die leeren Bäume verwenden soll. Füge im Test eine explizite Typannotation hinzu, z.B. ""minValueTree (Empty :: BinTree Int)"", damit der Typ eindeutig bestimmt ist und der Vergleich funktioniert.""

Sonst Top, macht richtig spaß und man bekommt ein schnelles Feedback auf seine Lösungsmöglichkeit!!"
